# Shopee-Clone

This is a Shopee-inspired website, where buyers can purchase products and use the shopping cart, while sellers can perform product and permission CRUD operations. Additionally, the platform features a queuing system for product purchases during high-demand events.

This is my home page ---> [Shopee Clone](https://hyperushle.com)
